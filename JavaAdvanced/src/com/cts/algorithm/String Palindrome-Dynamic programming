Problem : If a string is palindrome


1. Store the string in stringbuilder
2. call reverse method on the string
3. compare both the strings using equals method
4. if equal then it is palindrome.

without using built in method reverse

1. store the string
2. iterate over the string from length-1 to 0 using charAt
3. take each character and concat and create new string
4. compare both the string using equals method
5. if equal then it is palindrome
