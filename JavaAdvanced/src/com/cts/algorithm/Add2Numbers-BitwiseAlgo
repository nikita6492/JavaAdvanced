Problem: Add two numbers using bitwise algorithms

1. Initialize a variable sum to 0 and a variable carry to 0.

2. Iterate over the bits of the two numbers A and B, starting with the least significant bit. 

3. Set sum to the XOR of sum and A XOR B. 

4. Set carry to the AND of A and B. This will give us the carry over for the next iteration.

5. Left shift carry by 1. This is equivalent to multiplying it by 2 and preparing it to be added to the next set of bits.

6. Set A and B to the next set of bits in their respective numbers.

7. Repeat steps 2-6 until all the bits have been processed.

8. At the end, sum will contain the desired sum of the two numbers, 
and carry will be 0 if there was no carry over, or 1 if there was.
