Problem  = a[3]={1,2,3}
         a[4]={1,2,3,4}
         if there is any duplicate between these 2 arrays we have to ensure only one entry is there

      Approach 1:   
         1. As the problem demands of increasing the size of the array dynamically 
            use arraylist for storing values from both arrays
            
         2. iterate array with maximum size
         
         3. on each iteration of elements of first array, compare with each element from second array
         
         4. if count 0( no duplicate) simply add to arraylist
         
         5. if count greater than 0 than check if arraylist contains that element 
         
         6. if arraylist contains then don't add otherwise add it to the list.
         
         Suggested new approach:
         
         1. Merge both arrays
         
         2. Convert to set(duplicate values will be removed - onluy unique values will remain)
         
         3. again convert it to array
